# Improving quantification accuracy of a Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement imaging at -1.6 ppm at 4.7T using a Machine Learning Approach

###
This project focuses on using a Machine Learning (ML) model trained on partially synthetic Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) data combined with a curriculum learning denoising approach to predict Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement imaging at -1.6 ppm.
